# Crop Prediction and Analysis: 
The main objective of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model that recommends suitable crop ultimately optimizing agricultural yields and resource utilization. Crop_recommendation.csv is the dataset. The dataset consists of various variables data like Nitrogen(N),	Phosphorous(P), Potassium(k)	temperature, humidity,	ph,	rainfall,	label. Cropy.ipynb is the code for crop predictiona and analysis.
